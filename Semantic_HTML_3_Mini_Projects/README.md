# Semantic HTML — 3 Mini Projects — v3 (Detailed Comments + iframe)

This bundle is designed to teach **Semantic HTML** and **media embedding** step-by-step, using 3 mini projects.

✅ Every project requires:

- Semantic structure: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`
- Links: internal `#id` anchors + at least one external link
- Media: `img` (with `alt`), `audio controls`, `video controls`
- Embed: `iframe` (example: YouTube embed OR Google Maps embed)
- Accessibility basics: descriptive link text, `alt` text, titles/labels where helpful

## What “semantic” means

Semantic tags describe what content **IS**, not how it looks.

- `<header>` = top intro of the page/section
- `<nav>` = navigation links area
- `<main>` = the unique main content of the page
- `<section>` = grouped topic chunk
- `<article>` = a standalone item (card/post/resource)
- `<aside>` = supporting info (tips, related links)
- `<footer>` = bottom info (copyright, extra links)

## Why include media + iframe?

Because real websites are not just text.  
Mentees must learn:

- how to embed images/audio/video
- how to embed 3rd-party content via iframe
- how to keep it accessible (alt text, descriptive captions)

Open each `index.html` in your browser to test.
